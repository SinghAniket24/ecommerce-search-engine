# LLM Usage Documentation

## Purpose

Large Language Models (ChatGPT and Gemini) were used as engineering assistants to accelerate development and improve system design.

## Areas where LLM was used

* Designing search ranking algorithm
* Implementing BM25 ranking
* Improving fuzzy search logic
* Implementing FastAPI microservice structure
* Designing SQLite database schema
* Improving scraping logic
* Adding intent detection logic

## Role of LLM

LLMs were used for:

* Code suggestions
* Architecture guidance
* Debugging assistance
* Algorithm improvements

## Manual Engineering Work

All code was:

* Integrated manually
* Tested manually
* Verified manually
* Optimized manually

Final system design, integration, and testing were performed independently.

## Conclusion

LLMs were used as development tools to improve productivity and engineering quality, similar to using StackOverflow, documentation, or development tools.
